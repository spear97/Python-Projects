## Description
This was a project for my Programming Language Concepts Class that assigned to create a Monty Carlo Simulation using Python. This was implemented using Python, Visual Studio, Numpy, Pandas, and MatplotLib. The purpose of this program is to generate figures that would plot the results of of compound interest for a give amount and show how they would react overtime. 

## MonteCarlo

Monte Carlo is a computational method which utlizes sampling and statistical techniques to solve problems and make predicitions. It's prodomiently used in the fields of mathematics, physics, engineering, economics, finance, and computer science.

Within Monte Carlo Simulations, random numbers are used to model the behaviro of complex systems or to approximate mathematical expressions that are difficult or impossible to solve analytically. By generating a large number of random samples, statistical averages and probabilities can be calculated, leading to useful insights and predictions about the system under study.

For example, Monte Carlo simulations can be used to approximate the value of complex integrals, assess finacial risks, optimize processes, simulate particle interactions in physics, and perform uncertainty analysis in engineering, among many other applications. 

Overall, Monte Carlo methods are a powerful and versatile tool for solving problems in which deterministic approaches are not feasible or not practical.
